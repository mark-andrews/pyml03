# Introduction to Machine Learning and Deep Learning using Python

Python is one of the most widely used and highly valued programming languages
in the world, and is especially widely used in machine learning and for deep
learning. In this two day course, we provide an introduction to machine
learning and deep learning using Python. We begin by providing an overview of
the machine learning and deep learning landscape, and discuss the prominent
role that Python has come to play in this area. We then turn to machine
learning in practice, and for this, we will primarily using the widely used and
acclaimed `scikit-learn` toolbox. We begin with  binary and multiclass
classification problems, then look at decision trees and random forests, then
look at unsupervised learning methods, all of which are major topics in machine
learning. We then introduce artificial neural networks and deep learning.  For
this, we will use Tensorflow. We will cover how do do classification using deep
learning nets.


## Intended Audience

This course is aimed at anyone who is interested in learning the machine
learning or deep learning using Python, both of which have major applications
both in industry and in academia.

## Teaching Format

This course will be hands-on and workshop based. Throughout each day, there
will be some brief introductory remarks for each new topic, introducing and
explaining key concepts.

The course will take place online using Zoom. On each day, the live video broadcasts will occur between (UK local time) at:

* 10am-12pm
* 1pm-3pm
* 4pm-6pm

All the sessions will be video recorded, and made available immediately on a private video hosting website. Any materials, such as slides, data sets, etc., will be shared via GitHub.


## Assumed quantitative knowledge

We will assume familiarity with some general statistical and mathematical
concepts such as matrix algebra, calculus, probability distributions. However,
expertise with these concepts are not necessary. Anyone who has taken any
undergraduate (Bachelor's) level course in mathematics, or even advanced high
school level, can be assumed to have sufficient familiarity with these concepts.

## Assumed computer background

We assume familiarity with using Python, general purpose programming in Python,
and numerical programming in Python.  Note that both of these topics covered
comprehensively in two preceding two-day courses, which together will provide
all the computing prerequisites for this course.


## Equipment and software requirements

Attendees of the course must use a computer with Python (version 3) installed.
All the required software, including Python itself, the development and
programming environment tools, and the Python packages, are free and open source
and are available on Windows, MacOs, and Linux. Instructions on how to install
and configure all the software are [here](software.md).
We will also provide time during the workshops to ensure that all software is
installed and configured properly. For deep learning, we will also make use of
Google's Colaboratory https://colab.research.google.com/, which will give us
access to graphical processing units.

# Course programme

## Day 1

* Topic 1: *Machine learning and Deep Learning Landscape*. Concepts like machine
learning, deep learning, big data, data science have become widely used and
celebrated in the last 10 years. However, their definitions are relatively
nebulous, and how they related to one another and to major fields like
artificial intelligence and general statistics are not simple matters. In this
introduction, we briefly overview the field of machine learning and deep
learning, discussing its major characteristics and sub-topics, and also discuss
the prominence of Python in the area.

* Topic 2: *Classification problems*. Classification problems is one of the
bread and butter topics in machine learning, and is usually the first topic
covered in introductions to machine learning. Here, we will cover image
classification (itself a "hello world" type problem in machine learning), and
particularly focus on logistic regression and support vector machines (SVMs).

* Topic 3: *Decision trees and random forests*. Decision trees are a widely  
used machine learning method, particularly for classification. Random forests  
are an *ensemble learning* extension of decision trees whereby large number of
decision tree classifiers are aggregated, which often leads to much improved
performance.

## Day 2

* Topic 4: *Unsupervised machine learning*. Unsupervised learning is essentially
a method of finding patterns in unclassified data. Here, we will look at two of
the most widely used unsupervised techniques: k-means clustering and
probabilistic mixture models.

* Topic 5: *Introducing artificial neural networks and deep learning with
  Tensorflow*. Python provides many popular libraries for artificial neural
networks and deep learning. Here, we will use Tensorflow, which probably the
most widely used library. These models often use graphical processing units
(GPUs) for computing. Given that most personal computers don't have adequate
GPUs, we will use Google's Colaboratory https://colab.research.google.com/,
which is a free Python Jupyter notebook service from Google.

* Topic 6: *Classification with multilayer perceptons*. Multilayer perceptrons are very powerful,
yet relatively easy to understand, artificial neural networks. They are the best types of models to start with when learning deep learning because they allow us to explore all the major principles of deep learning in a relatively straightforward manner. Here, we will build and train a
multilayer perceptron for a classification problem.
